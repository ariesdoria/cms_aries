# Getting Started
## Pre-requisites
1. Make sure that you first install a server dedicated to run PHP files like XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP.
2. Install composer on your local machine to load the dependencies necessary for the project.
3. A good text editor or IDE like SublimeText or PHPStorm to edit the PHP files.

Once you have set your local machine, next thing you need to do is clone the project to the folder <b>htdocs</b> under the <b>xampp</b> folder in your machine, using versioning controls like Git or SourceTree. After setting it up, you will have to go to the <b>phpMyAdmin</b> and load the necessary <b>SQL</b> files necessary for the project's database.
